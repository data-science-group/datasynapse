This file explains how to enrich Twitter files.

The Api receives a directory as the input. The directory should contain a set of Twitter files in json format.
 Then the Api enrich and return a set of json files in the same directory.

The path of Twitter json files can be set in config\config.ini file as following:
 path = Users\\Alireza\\PycharmProjects\\Twitter\\JsonSample\\
 The text in front of 'path' keyword is the path of directory that contains Twitter Json sample files.

 The output:
 The Api enriches every Twitter json file and stores the enriched files into the input directory.
 To distinguish the output file against the original Twitter files the Apis adds enriched keyword to every file.

 Example:
 If the name of input file being 'Test.json' the enriched version of this file will be 'enrichedTest.json' and will be placed in the same directory as the input file.

 Customizing the API
 Currently the API extracts Named-Entites, POS-Tags, Stem, Keyword, and profile Info from every input file.
 The API sends rest request to a server that carry out the process of enrichment. The name of server is
 "http://d2dcrc.cse.unsw.edu.au:9091/ExtractionAPI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"

 Following commands shows how to send a single request to server.
  1- named entities:

 http://d2dcrc.cse.unsw.edu.au:9091/ExtractionAPI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/rest/entity/?ent='Sydney is a city in Australia'
 The first part(from beginning until ent) is the server path for extracting named entities.

 'ent' is an static parameter that receives the input parameter

 The last part (after 'ent=') is the text for extracting named entities. The API relies on stanford named entity recognizer in addition to a gazetter that contains 52000 extract named entities. For furthur information please refer to the paper 'On Automatic Basic Data Curation API' published on WWW 17.

  2- Pos Tag:
  http://d2dcrc.cse.unsw.edu.au:9091/ExtractionAPI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/rest/postag/?tag='This is a test'

  The structure of request for extracting POS tag is similar to named entities, which made up of three parts:
  The first part is the server path http://d2dcrc.cse.unsw.edu.au:9091/ExtractionAPI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/rest/postag/ for extracing pos tags.
  The second part is the 'tag', which is a static parameter that receives the input data.
  The third part is the text for extracting pos tag.

  3- Keyword:

  http://d2dcrc.cse.unsw.edu.au:9091/ExtractionAPI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/rest/keyword/?sentence='This is a test'

  The structure of request for extracting keyword is similar to previous requests and is made up of three parts:

  The first part is the server path http://d2dcrc.cse.unsw.edu.au:9091/ExtractionAPI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/rest/keyword/ for extracing keyword.
  The second part is the 'sentence', which is a static parameter that receives the input data.
  The third part is the text for extracting keywords.
